# Wild Glazes

This is an experiment in documenting glazing on different bodies, in documenting the outcomes, and trying to mix new glazes.


Glazing is chemistry plus fire plus unpredictable reactions. 


Lets start documenting and possibly we can come up with some conclusions.  
[Starting point](#Start), [Clay](#Clay), [Porcelain](#Porcelain) & [Toppings](#Glaze)


## Starting point 


No matter what ...


## Clay 


Earthenware


## Porcelain 


white gold


## Glaze 


A *color* is a color is a color. And how do it calculate the mix: Try [Glazy](https://help.glazy.org/guide/calculator/)


### Examples & How to
There are two main types of elements:

- **Sections** – Larger blocks gather the material for weekly course sessions.
- **Items** – Smaller elements feature images, text, and other content.

Each item is connected with its section by a thin line. The navigation (≡) gives access to all sections.

The last section acts as the footer, where the typical array of logos and links belongs.

The template is in use to document the following [Interface Design](https://interface.fh-potsdam.de) courses offered at [FH Potsdam](https://www.fh-potsdam.de/):

- **[Decolonizing Data Visualization – Visualizing Postcolonies](https://infovis.fh-potsdam.de/decolonizing/)** (Summer 2022)
- **[Organigrams for/from the future](https://infovis.fh-potsdam.de/organigrams/)** (Summer 2023)

### Files

The template has the following file structure:

      img/
      index.html
      src/
      README.md

The `README.md` file contains all the textual content of your page and references the images that you need to add to the `img/` directory. 

The `index.html` file connects template and your content; here you need to make a few edits to add title, description, and preview of your webpage. 

You do not need to change anything within `src/`, which contains the internal files of the template.


### Syntax

The `README.md` uses the [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format, a markup language used by many platforms including GitHub.

There are two conventions we introduce to distinguish and connect sections and items:

- **Sections** are delineated by a horizontal rule `---` 
- **Items** are separated by two empty consecutive lines

Each section should contain a heading:
`#` for primary, `##` for secondary, and so on.

To exclude a section from the navigation menu, include `<!--skipnav-->` at the start of the section.



### Things to consider

- Include an expressive preview image `img/cover.png` so that your page can be previewed on social media and messaging apps.
- Given that your webpage might be accessed from a mobile device with a slow connection make sure to optimize image file sizes.
