# Wild Glazes

This is an experiment in documenting glazing on different bodies, in documenting the outcomes and combinations.


Glazing is chemistry plus fire plus unpredictable reactions.

# Characteristics of porcelain

## The history of porcelain making
### Early Origins
Porcelain making originated in China during the Eastern Han Dynasty (around 100 CE). The exact techniques and materials used in early Chinese porcelain production remain somewhat mysterious, but it's believed that a combination of kaolin clay and a special type of stone called petuntse (or china stone) were key ingredients.
Chinese Porcelain: Chinese porcelain production reached its peak during the Tang (618–907) and Song (960–1279) Dynasties. These periods saw significant advancements in kiln technology and glazing techniques. Chinese porcelain became highly prized both domestically and internationally, with porcelain objects being exported along the Silk Road to regions such as the Middle East and Europe.


### Introduction to Europe
Porcelain became known in Europe during the Middle Ages through trade with the Islamic world and later with China. However, it wasn't until the early 18th century that European attempts to replicate Chinese porcelain were successful.
Meissen Porcelain: In 1708, the Meissen porcelain factory in Germany produced the first true hard-paste porcelain in Europe. This achievement was the result of extensive experimentation by alchemist Johann Friedrich Böttger and the support of Augustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony. Meissen porcelain quickly gained popularity throughout Europe.


### Development in Europe
Following Meissen, other European countries began establishing their own porcelain factories, each contributing to the development of porcelain production techniques and styles. Factories in England, France, and other European countries made significant advancements in porcelain making throughout the 18th and 19th centuries.
Industrialization and Globalization: The Industrial Revolution brought about significant changes in porcelain production, with the introduction of mechanized methods and mass production techniques. Porcelain became more accessible to a wider range of people, and its production spread to various parts of the world.


### Modern Era
Porcelain making continues to evolve with advancements in materials, technology, and design. While traditional techniques are still practiced, contemporary artists and designers are pushing the boundaries of what porcelain can be, experimenting with new forms, glazes, and applications.


## What is porcelain made of?
Porcelain is primarily made of a combination of materials, typically including kaolin and feldspar, along with other materials like quartz, silica, and mineral oxides. The specific composition can vary depending on the type of porcelain being produced and its intended use. Generally, kaolin comprises the largest percentage of porcelain's composition, often ranging from 25% to 50%, while feldspar can make up around 25% to 35%. Other materials fill in the remaining percentages.

## What is clay made of?
Earthenware is a type of ceramic pottery made from clay. The composition of earthenware clay can vary, but it typically consists of a mixture of clay minerals, such as kaolinite, along with other minerals like quartz, feldspar, and iron oxides. The exact percentages of these components can vary depending on the specific type of earthenware clay and its intended use. In general, earthenware clay contains a higher proportion of impurities compared to other types of clay, resulting in a more porous and less durable finished product.
